# tensorflow_tutorials
Tensorflow tutorials I recreated and added my own comments to as well as made it runnable via code editor instead of jupyter notebook. To run make sure to have conda env with: matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and tensorflow all running on Python 2.7 as anything above 2.7 currently breaks.
